# MOVREC
A content based movie recommending system on textual data analysis using cosine similarity. The approach involves preprocessing movie metadata such as overviews, genres, keywords, cast, and crew information to generate descriptive tags. These tags are then vectorized and compared using cosine similarity to recommend movies similar to a given input.
